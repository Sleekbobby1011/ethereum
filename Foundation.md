The Ethereum Foundation is a non-profit organization registered in Switzerland, and has the purpose of managing the funds that were raised from the Ether Sale in order to best serve the Ethereum and decentralized technology ecosystem.

To that end, aside from its expenditures supporting Ethereum development, the Ethereum Foundation is also participating in a number of industry collaboration efforts.

The Cryptocurrency Research Group (link: ccrg.org) is the first multidisciplinary cross-industry research organization dedicated to solving the hard problems in cryptocurrency, including technical issues of consensus and scalability, development and evaluation of game-theoretic mechanisms useful in many kinds of smart contracts, as well as legal and practical issues relating to the intersection of the cryptographic world and the real world. The Ethereum Foundation is providing an initial grant to the CCRG, but the organization is in the process of actively expanding to include multiple stakeholders from academia, business and elsewhere.

### Industry Collaboration

The Ethereum Foundation is participating in and contributing, both financially and with the active involvement of our members, to a number of efforts that provide value to the cryptocurrency, payments and web technology space. We proudly support the [Coin Center](http://coincenter.org), a non-profit organization based in Washington dedicated to researching the legal implications of cryptocurrency and engaging in policy advocacy efforts, and are members of the W3C Web Payments Group.
