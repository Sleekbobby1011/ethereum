### Easy to Develop

One of the primary focuses of the Ethereum team is building development tools to help users more easily develop applications on top of the Ethereum platform. All of the technical complexities of managing distributed consensus and maintaining common peer-to-peer networking infrastructure are handled by ourselves so you don't have to.

# Easy to Use

The [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist) client aims to provide a solid, unified experience for browsing the decentralized web, making the user experience as simple as installing and using an app on Android or Chrome. Mist handles account management, key management, blockchain synchronization and other details for you so you don't have to.

# Trustful

Ethereum's decentralized infrastructure is guaranteed to continue being online for as long as at least a single user continues to participate in the network, and cannot arbitrarily and unexpectedly be shut down, change its offerings, exclude or discriminate against specific categories of users, or undesirably modify its terms of service. The community alone is ultimately in charge.

# Advanced

Ethereum incorporates the latest developments in peer-to-peer and cryptoeconomic technology, giving developers and users access to top-of-the-line guarantees of flexibility, accessibility and speed among technologies of its class. The underlying technologies continue to be in active development, and developers will gain access to new features as soon as we are comfortable that they will be ready for use.

# Technology

1. Ethereum is a platform that makes it much easier to develop and use next-generation decentralized applications.

2. Ether, Ethereum's cryptofuel, powers the applications on the decentralized network.

3. A small amount of ether is required in order to send any transaction, and the more computation a transaction requires the more ether it consumes.

4. A contract is a program that lives inside of Ethereum's secure, decentralized environment. Contracts are the main building blocks of Ethereum.

5. Sending a transaction to a contract causes its code to execute. Contracts can store data, send transactions and interact with other contracts.

6. Contracts can be used to build currencies, financial derivatives, voting systems, decentralized organizations, data feeds, title registries and thousands of other applications.

7. [Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist), the Ethereum client, is your window to the decentralized world. Decentralized applications built for Ethereum can be used inside of Mist, and look and feel just like any other web application would.

8. Ethereum can be used as a building block to help codify, decentralize, secure and trade almost anything.


# Cool Philosophy Blurb

Most of the services you use today have something in common: they are centralized. When you deposit money at your bank, post pictures on Facebook or send an email to your friend, you are trusting them to be honest, highly diligent about their security and as interested in protecting your privacy and well-being as you are. History has shown that in reality, this is not nearly always in fact the case. Unfortunately, as flawed as this model is, for technological reasons it has so far been necessary; there was simply no other way to use a digital or financial service without someone, somewhere, being a single point of failure and a trusted operator at the helm.

Enter Ethereum.

Ethereum is a platform that integrates the latest developments in cryptography and cryptoeconomics, branches of computer science that deal with the precise question of how to build services without the need for single points of failure and without the need for trust, instead providing hard quantifiable assurances of security. By using tools such as public key cryptography, distributed hash tables and the Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum not only has the potential to resolve the above issues in industries that already exist, but also open the door to whole new kinds of applications that we have never seen before.
