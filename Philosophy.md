### Blurb

Most of the services you use today have something in common: they are centralized. When you deposit money at your bank, post pictures on Facebook or send an email to your friend, you are trusting them to be honest, highly diligent about their security and as interested in protecting your privacy and well-being as you are. History has shown that in reality, this is not nearly always in fact the case. Unfortunately, as flawed as this model is, for technological reasons it has so far been necessary; there was simply no other way to use a digital or financial service without someone, somewhere, being a single point of failure and a trusted operator at the helm.

Enter Ethereum.

Ethereum is a platform that integrates the latest developments in cryptography and cryptoeconomics, branches of computer science that deal with the precise question of how to build services without the need for single points of failure and without the need for trust, instead providing hard quantifiable assurances of security. By using tools such as public key cryptography, distributed hash tables and the Ethereum blockchain, Ethereum not only has the potential to resolve the above issues in industries that already exist, but also open the door to whole new kinds of applications that we have never seen before.

### Technology

Ethereum is a platform that makes it much easier to develop and use next-generation decentralized applications.

2

Ether, Ethereum's cryptofuel, powers the applications on the decentralized network.

3

A small amount of ether is required in order to send any transaction, and the more computation a transaction requires the more ether it consumes.

4

A contract is a program that lives inside of Ethereum's secure, decentralized environment. Contracts are the main building blocks of Ethereum.

5

Sending a transaction to a contract causes its code to execute. Contracts can store data, send transactions and interact with other contracts.

6

Contracts can be used to build currencies, financial derivatives, voting systems, decentralized organizations, data feeds, title registries and thousands of other applications.

7

Mist, the Ethereum client, is your window to the decentralized world. Decentralized applications built for Ethereum can be used inside of Mist, and look and feel just like any other web application would.

8

Ethereum can be used as a building block to help codify, decentralize, secure and trade almost anything.
