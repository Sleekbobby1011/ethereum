### 1 
Ethereum is a platform that makes it possible for any developer to easily build and publish next-generation distributed applications.

### 2
Ether, Ethereum's cryptofuel, powers the applications on the decentralized network.

### 3
A small amount of ether is required in order to send any transaction, and the more computation a transaction requires the more ether it consumes.

### 4
Contracts are the main building blocks of Ethereum.

### 5
Sending a transaction to a contract causes its code to execute. Contracts can store data, send transactions and interact with other contracts.

### 6
Contracts can be used to build currencies, financial derivatives, voting systems, decentralized organizations, data feeds, title registries and thousands of other applications.

### 7
[Mist](https://github.com/ethereum/mist), the Ethereum client, is your window to the decentralized world. Decentralized applications built for Ethereum can be used inside of Mist, and look and feel just like any other web application would.

### 8
Ethereum can be used to codify, decentralize, secure and trade almost anything.
